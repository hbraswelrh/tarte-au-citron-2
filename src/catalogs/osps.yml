      description: |
        The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a set of fundamental,
        sound, and secure software development practices based on established
        secure software development practice documents from organizations such as
        BSA, OWASP, and SAFECode. Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models
        explicitly address software security in detail, so practices like those in
        the SSDF need to be added to and integrated with each SDLC implementation.
        Following the SSDF practices should help software producers reduce the
        number of vulnerabilities in released software, reduce the potential impact
        of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and
        address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences. Also,
        because the SSDF provides a common language for describing secure software
        development practices, software producers and acquirers can use it to foster
        their communications for procurement processes and other management activities.

    description: |
      Quality focuses on the processes and
      practices used to ensure the quality and
      reliability of the project's source code and
      software assets. These controls help ensure
      that the project's source code is well
      maintained, secure, and reliable, reducing the
      risk of defects or vulnerabilities in the
      software.

          The project's version control system MUST require at least one
          non-author approval of changes to the primary branch.
        objective: |
          Ensure that the project's version control system requires at least one
          non-author approval of changes before merging into the release or primary
          branch.

              When a commit is made to the primary branch, the project's version
              control system MUST require at least one non-author approval of the
              changes before merging.
            applicability:
              - Maturity Level 3
            recommendation: |
              Configure the project's version control system to require at least one
              non-author approval of changes before merging into the release or
              primary branch. This can be achieved by requiring a pull request to be
              reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor before it can
              be merged.

      a recognized and legally enforceable open source 
      software license, reducing the risk of intellectual 
      property disputes or licensing violations.

              General Public License (GPL). Releasing to the public domain meets
