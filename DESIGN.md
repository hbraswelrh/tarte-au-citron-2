# baseline-demo

This repository provides a demonstration on how to use the `compliance-to-policy` project to automate evidence generation and collection to
demonstrate adherence to the [OSPS Baseline](https://baseline.openssf.org/versions/2025-02-25) controls

# Overview
The `compliance-to-policy` project under OSCAL Compass acts as an overarching translation layer between Compliance-as-Code artifacts (like OSCAL) and native formats for various
policy engines and assessment tools. It provides the framework and core logic for this translation, effectively bridging the gap between high-level compliance
requirements and their concrete implementation as executable policies.
The goal is to provide consistency for reporting and evidence traceability while allowing flexible deployment and support for diverse policy and assessment tools.

# Demo

To goal of this repository is to demonstrate the evaluation and reporting of a single component, in this case a GitHub Repository.

The `Generate` workflow can be run which will complete the following steps:

1. Transform the Gemara Layers 2, 3, and 4 artifacts into an OSCAL Component Definitions with OSCAL Compass property extensions
2. Provide the OSCAL Component Definition as inputs in the c2pcli with a [Conforma](https://github.com/conforma) plugin to provide an OPA bundle that contain all the policies required for evaluation and a `policy.yaml` to allow
   data input mapping to policies.
3. The policy bundle is pushed as an OCI artifact to `ghcr.io`

The `Report` workflow and be used to provide immediate feedback on the compliance posture of the component. It completes the following steps:

1. Use `snappy` to retrieve input data from the API and use `ec validate input` to evaluate the input data using the policy in the bundle.
2. Use the policy results, the OSCAL Component Definition and input OSCAL Catalog to produce an OSCAL Assessment Results and Markdown report.
3. The Markdown report is available in the job run as a step summary.

> Note: This report demonstration currently does not account for long-term storage of evidence, but provides short-term access to evidence all co-located and links on the GitHub job.

# Repository Layout

`src` - Contains `gemara` authored content used for transformation  
`policy.yaml` - The `conforma` policy configuration file used to perform evaluations   
`policy-templates` - Contains Rego policies published for use with `conforma`
